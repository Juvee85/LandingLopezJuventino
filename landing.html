                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite activities is listening to music. My favorite genres are rock and its derivatives, but I like to listen to a variety of styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like to play musical instruments. Primarily, I play string instruments like the guitar, bass, and ukulele; but I am also learning to play the violin, keyboard, and to sing. Playing music with any instrument is something I find entertaining and helps me to distract myself from daily activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recorded some songs with friends that you can find on Spotify via this

                </p>
                <h4>Videogames</h4>
                <p>
                    Probably what I do the most with my free time is playing videogames. My favorite games are generally indie games or Nintendo games, and I mainly play on a Switch or my laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite videogame genres are platformers, strategy games, rhythm games, and racing games. But, like with music, I play a fairly wide variety, some of my favorite games don't fit into the categories I mentioned, such as Tetris or Katamari Damacy.
